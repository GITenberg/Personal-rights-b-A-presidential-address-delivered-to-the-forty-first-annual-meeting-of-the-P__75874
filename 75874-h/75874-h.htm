<p><span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>:—I used to feel some
impatience with public speakers who spent half their
speech in explaining how it was they had committed
the indiscretion of making it, and how much more
suitable for the post somebody else would have been.</p>

<p>Those gentlemen now have my profoundest
sympathy!</p>

<p>I feel that I ought to spend not half, but my whole
speech, in explaining why I have the temerity to address
you tonight on this familiar subject, seeing that I
never do speak in public, and that my feelings about
taking the chair are very much like they would be
about taking a cold plunge in the Atlantic in early
spring.</p>

<p>However, I can’t get rid of my deficiencies by
enumerating them, so I must just throw myself on
your mercy, asking you to regard this venture as a
tribute of admiration and gratitude to our President
and his supporters who have made so magnificent a
defence of the Cause for so many thankless years.
Also I have felt moved to accept the honour on account
of the scarcity of wholehearted champions, especially—I
regret to hear—among the sex which has always
been deprived of personal rights.</p>

<p>Perhaps that is just why they <em>are</em> lacking in respect
for them! And what a warning this is! The spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
of liberty, it would appear, can be starved to death.
Society, having done its foolish best to destroy that
spirit in half its members, expects the other half to
retain it unimpaired—an obvious impossibility. For
interaction of influence is incessant and universal
between the two sexes.</p>

<p>The career of women having depended not on right
but on favour, they have learnt to care little for an
abstract idea which has no bearing on their lives.
Only the exceptional mind cares for that. But similar
conditions would assuredly produce the same result
in men. And—we are on our rapid way to similar
conditions.</p>

<p>Now, in a vast subject like this, which really touches
the heart of everything that is vital and valuable in
life, it is impossible, in twenty-five minutes to deal
with it in any detail; and I propose tonight simply
to dwell upon the perils with which we are all
threatened, in consequence of the present trend of
sentiment. For we have to try and make these perils
obvious to the hearts as well as to the minds of our
contemporaries, if there is to be any hope of checking
the present downward tendencies.</p>

<p>It is of little use merely <em>stating</em> that it is perilous to
try to purchase social benefits at the expense of
individuals. To the majority, that seems the safest
thing in the world; and, strange to say, the most just.
The ancient idea of vicarious sacrifice is as rampant
today as it was when the groves of ancient temples
echoed with the cries of human victims, burnt on the
altars, for the appeasement of the gods and the good
of the community.</p>

<p>The idea of <em>numbers</em> enters largely into the popular
idea of right and wrong—what I call arithmetical
morality. Because 100 is ten times more than 10, it
is assumed that ten <em>persons</em> may justly be sacrificed for
the sake of the 100. But that is to confuse mere nonsentient
signs with living conscious beings; surely a
strangely stupid proceeding. It is this deeply-rooted
idea which we have to combat.</p>

<p>First of all then, it must be noted, that, as a rule,
the less liberty people enjoy, the less they value or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
respect it. The preoccupation will be not with
liberty but with the best means of getting on without
it. And the best way of doing that will be—or will
seem to be—to force your own views as much as
possible upon your neighbours—otherwise they will
force theirs upon <em>you</em>. Mutually lacking in respect for
liberty, there will be as many good reasons for attacking
it in others as you have theories to enforce. And
the same for them. The situation must obviously end
in a stupendous tyranny of some kind: whether of
king or oligarchy or State: and that of the State,
being practically invulnerable, is the worst of all.</p>

<p>I am far from thinking that the motive for aggression
would always be self-interest. It would be less
dangerous if it were. We all know the deadly tyranny
of the thoroughly well-meaning person: the highly-moral
person, for instance, who calls out for mediæval
forms of punishment for especially reprobated crimes.
As some philosopher said: “He must be an extraordinarily
good man before he can safely be guided by
his conscience.” I go farther, and say: “The extraordinarily
good man must be trained for a lifetime by
the Personal Rights Association before he can trust
his conscience—and even then he had better not!”</p>

<p>Of all human attributes, conscience, when backed
by power over others, seems to be the most dangerous.
Think what martyr-fires it has lighted,
what torture-chambers it has furnished and kept
busy! If we had only self-interest to deal with,
we should not be troubled with the present ardent
desire of increasing numbers of people, to further the
interests of Society—of morals, medicine, science—even
what are called the true interests of the individual
himself, by progressive outrage against him.
It is this eternal “good motive” that makes our
reformers as irresistible as a swarm of locusts, and as
destructive! The bravest of us flinch before Virtue
on the war-path.</p>

<p>Before they have done, our philanthropic locusts
will have eaten off every green blade and leaf of
human initiative, and will leave the Society which
they so yearn to serve barren and blight-stricken,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
perhaps for centuries to come. Of what value to any
one is such a Society? What in fact, <em>exists</em>, but
individuals?</p>

<p>And mark: there is no retracing our steps if we go
too far in this direction. We are always assured that
there would be a reaction against a too great
restriction of the human spirit. But that is true only
so long as the restriction is more or less a novelty and
is <em>not</em> too great. Directly it becomes really extreme,
there is no reaction. We can see this in the innumerable
nations of antiquity and of today which have
remained stagnant for hundreds and hundreds of
years. Lack of human rights tends progressively to
stifle the spirit that would demand or respect them.
Even in England, whose history is that of the struggle
for liberty, we have seen how, in women, that spirit
has been weakened. How then are we to hope—after
a too deep descent to Avernus—for a return towards
the light and inspiration of freedom? It is expecting
a result without a cause—or rather in the teeth of one.</p>

<p>Like Xerxes, stupidly confident, we burn our boats
behind us. Or, more accurately, Nature burns them
for us. She seems to say: “Very well; if you don’t
want to give scope to original minds, you have only
to make your social conditions accordingly—subordinate
your individual ruthlessly to what you call
‘the common good’—and original minds will never
trouble you again. Not only will your organization
suppress them, but it will gradually destroy your
power even to produce them. That will save <em>them</em> an
immensity of trouble, and prevent all hitches in your
boring routine. If that’s what you want, it is easily
yours.”</p>

<p>But our reformers <em>don’t</em> exactly want that. They
like to have it both ways. They want a subservient,
State-ridden community of highly individualized
human beings, who—like the inmates of Barry’s Home
for Geniuses—would initiate punctually and spontaneously
to order—in the approved direction, of
course. No fantastic unexpected nonsense would be
tolerated for a moment!</p>

<p>The old pathetic story of Midas, whose wish—granted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
by the gods—that everything he touched
should turn to gold, seems vaguely symbolic of this
eager desire to turn living, initiating individuals into
subservient parts of a social Whole. It is possible to
have a prayer too completely answered, as poor Midas
found, when his best cook’s masterpieces became hard
yellow metal under his teeth, till he starved amidst
fabulous riches; while his heart was finally broken
when his little daughter, running in to bid him good
morning, was changed into a priceless golden statue.
Like Midas, our reformers are short-sighted. Their
eyes are so fixed on the Golden Age that they want to
bring about for humanity, that they forget that they
may be killing humanity in the process—the very
spring and life-essence of the human material which
they—meddling little amateur deities—are trying so
hard to make after their own image.</p>

<p>Our philanthropists will find when too late, that
they have turned all that is living into hard, precious,
valueless gold—the gold of a mechanical social order—if
the gods are cruel enough to grant their foolish
prayers!</p>

<p>I do not say that the day of awakening would never
come. To China and Japan for instance, it <em>has</em> at
last come—through <em>outside</em> not internal causes, be it
noted. But think of the spell-bound, horrible ages of
night-mare-ridden sleep that went before!</p>

<p>Once upon a time in old Japan, a man was not
allowed to give his grandchild a doll measuring more
than certain carefully prescribed dimensions. The
paternal Powers deemed moderation in dolls to be
desirable, and so curbed undue enthusiasm in grandparents
by solemn legislative measures. It is claimed
by its admirers that the system (whose nature we can
gauge from this instance) worked admirably.
Probably it did. So does a regularly-wound clock.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the better the preposterous
system worked, the more fatally it would strangle its
victims. Now it is this fact which we all have to
try to make clear to our opponents. Humanity
growing fat and prosperous on banquets of immolated
individuals would be about as disastrous a condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
as one could well imagine. As a matter of fact
“Humanity”—a mere abstract term used for convenience
of speech—has been endowed by careless
thinkers with a sort of divine self-existence; and, like
most divine beings, this new deity demands sacrifices.
For instance, the recent medical proposal to dissect
criminals alive in the interests of the Community—another
collective-term fetish—reveals, in typical
form, the line of sentiment (I can scarcely call it
thought) against which we have to contend. I do not
say that the majority would not still be shocked at
this proposal; but that is simply because it has not
yet become familiar. Once it does become familiar,
the horror will die away (think of the everyday
atrocities which <em>have</em> the public sanction) and then—as
there is no principle of personal rights to stand
between the proposed victim and the eager experimenter—the
latter will be allowed to take his long-coveted
prize. He is already permitted to take innocent,
sentient creatures, on the plea of the public good;
and it is only carrying out the theory to its logical
conclusion, to take guilty ones for the same purpose.
And on the same plea—like the lie, “an ever present
help in time of trouble”—the ordinary citizen will
probably follow, in due course. It is a question of
time and sentiment, not of principle.</p>

<p>Now is it quite impossible to awaken the public to
the awful and innumerable dangers which confront us
all, as soon as the protection of personal rights is
withdrawn? Will not even this threat of human
vivisection reveal our utter defencelessness?</p>

<p>Can we not persuade our contemporaries to ask
themselves if, for instance, the apostles of eugenics
have shrunk from <em>any</em> measure, however outrageous,
which they thought promised the desired results?
Provided the end is gained, the individual must pay
the price. It seems to be thought unworthy of him to
object. Thus he is placed at the mercy of every wind
and tide of popular opinion, or, what is worse, at the
mercy of the views of experts who naturally tend to
think all things lawful which benefit their particular
branch of knowledge. If vaccination is approved of,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
vaccinated the individual must be. If Science demands
human vivisection, he must submit even to that outrage.
On what principle, except that of personal rights,
can the demand be refused? The outrage <em>might</em> result
in valuable knowledge. Again, if Society is obsessed
by a crude and unproved theory of heredity, how are
we to resist interference with our marriages, or being
treated as hysterical, or feeble-minded, or degenerate,
or insane? Genius and originality generally seem
pathological to the majority; and what the end will
be of this sort of old-Japanese system, considering its
very vigorous beginning, is not cheering to prophesy.</p>

<p>Unless its very absurdity causes a reaction before it
is too late, we shall find ourselves in the current of an
evolution backwards to the savage state, in which the
individual is very like that foolish and much overrated
insect, the bee, hopelessly submerged in the
social hive.</p>

<p>As originality is usually lodged in a peculiarly
sensitive organism, delicately responsive to conditions,
it would tend to atrophy, as plants do whose leaves
and buds are persistently nipped off. No living thing
can stand the process long. It is one of the shallowest
of popular fallacies that genius always overcomes
obstacles. It depends on the obstacles and the kind
of genius; or, more accurately, on the ordinary
qualities with which the genius happens to be
accompanied. In itself, genius is a handicap, not an
aid, to outward success.</p>

<p>Now in the degenerating society which we are considering,
its path of descent is easy to trace. Observe
the increasing tragedy of the situation. As the strata
of what I call Hive-heredity accumulate, there is
always a deeper and deeper soil of Hive-instinct out
of which each new generation has to spring. Is it not
progressively unlikely, therefore, that “sports” would
appear? And if they did appear, at lengthening
intervals, would they not be handicapped by a strong
Herd-instinct, impregnably seated in that reservoir of
inborn impulse that we now call the “subconscious”?</p>

<p>The more one dwells on this principle of ours, the
more its essential truth and beauty and sanity is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
revealed. It is so gloriously universal in its scope!
Just in so far as man or animal can enjoy rights or
suffer wrongs, just so far we demand for him protection.
We deem it absurd and irrelevant to ask
questions as to his faith or his morals, or his “importance”;
as to the number of his legs, or the nature of
his covering. It is obviously enough that he can <em>feel</em>.</p>

<p>We do not say: “He has no friends; let us make
him suffer for our good.” We say: “He is in our
hands; therefore we are his guardians to a man ...
and woman!”</p>

<p>And as a result of this loyalty to the least of our
brethren, we should find—if we could but make it universal—that
we had made impregnable our one line of
defence against innumerable dangers and evils—our
Chatalga lines, we might call them, of inalienable
Personal Rights.</p>

<p>And in strengthening these for the protection of the
humblest as well as the greatest of our brethren, we
render increasingly possible all that makes life interesting,
dramatic, and truly worth the living: all adventures
of the human spirit. A vista of possibilities
is thus opened which promises an enrichment in all
the relations of life, an enlargement of the range of
consciousness, and therefore of progress, to which we
can actually set no limits.</p>

<p>Compare this with the unspeakable boredom of the
hurdy-gurdy existence of a State-dominated community!</p>

<p>Those who have been used all their lives to the
atmosphere of civilization, often do not realize how
easily it can be destroyed. The curious change that
comes over educated persons who have lived long in
the backwoods, gives a hint of my meaning. As a
rule, the man—or woman—has in some way dwindled.
The consciousness and comprehension have narrowed,
the perceptions are poorer, slower, less human. The
companioning element has almost gone, and one feels
that the common meeting-ground of civilized humanity
has shrivelled almost to nothing. And so one can but
realize that a certain fine flower of the human spirit—which
might be still further glorified and developed—can,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
on the other hand, be swiftly annihilated. Humanity,
so to speak, loses its level, like a traveller who has
mistaken his way, and walks down hill only to have
to come up again, or else to resign himself to remaining
on the plains—he who had set out for the
mountains!</p>

<p>Now, what if this be the reason that civilizations
blossom only to decay? I utterly disbelieve in the
facile and misleading analogy of the “social <em>organism</em>.”</p>

<p>Societies do indeed change, but they do <em>not</em> go
through an exactly-repeated series of stages after the
fashion of “organisms.” It is quite unproved that
there is any inherent “principle of decay.” What, in
fact, <i>is</i> a principle of decay?</p>

<p>Now, it seems probable that one cause of decay is
just this perpetual losing of level. Like Penelope,
humanity has always kept on undoing its own work,
and beginning all over again. And so our civilizations
naturally wither! And is this not, mainly,
because we have never yet learnt a true love of
Liberty? Suppose for a moment, a universal respect
for it such as I have just been imagining: a society
wherein there was a real passion for protecting and
liberating and giving scope to the individual impulse
and inspiration. Is it not almost certain that this
incessant loss of level—this destruction of previous
achievement would be avoided? And if it were—what
is to prevent our Traveller reaching the Mountains
he set out for?</p>
